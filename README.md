# Multi-Armed-Bandit-Simulator
Applications sometimes call for an algorithm which learns quickly, but sacrifices optimal long term performance. The inherent tradeoffs with learning algorithms lead to varying performance in the short term, within 200 iterations and long term, at 1000 iterations. 
	The choice of the multi-arm bandit problem is motivated by its application to machine learning as a way to effectively measure the performance of learning algorithms. Our paper strengthens the results of the previous papers. It aims to present the optimal choice of the learning algorithm based on a Gaussian or Bernoulli distribution, with a practical and easy-to-understand implementation of the algorithm.
